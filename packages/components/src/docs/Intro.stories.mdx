# RhinoUI Design System

Welcome to the RhinoUI Design System, whose purpose is to help us deliver high quality Rhinolabs applications, faster and better. It consists of the following:

- [RhinoUI Components](https://github.com/rhinolabs/rhino-ui) - an open source, react-based, component library for Rhinolabs applications and websites.
- [RhinoUI Design Tokens](https://github.com/rhinolabs/rhino-ui/tree/main/packages/design-tokens) - A central location to store shared attributes of the Rhinolabs Design System. These include things like color, fonts, spacing, and more.
- Brand Assets: _coming soon_
- [Content Guidelines](?path=/story/content-goals-and-principles--page) - A guide for applying Rhinolabs's voice and tone in your writing.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to the UX Team on Slack (#ux). One of our missions is build tools to make your job easier and you more successful, so please don't hesitate to reach out.
