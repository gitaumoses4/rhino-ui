### What is RhinoUI
[RhinoUI](https://github.com/rhinolabs/rhino-ui) is an open-source frontend library designed to make integrating UI components into your projects as straightforward as possible. Offering components, design tokens, and React hooks, it equips developers with everything needed to create modern, efficient, and cohesive user interfaces. Explore RhinoUI and discover how it can streamline and enhance your development process!

### Why RhinoUI?

Choosing RhinoUI for your project means opting for simplicity, efficiency, and innovation. Here are a few reasons why RhinoUI stands out:

- **Simplicity**: RhinoUI's components are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to focus more on creating unique user experiences rather than wrestling with complex code.

- **Efficiency**: With RhinoUI, you can significantly reduce development time. Our library provides a comprehensive set of tools that work seamlessly together, streamlining the development process from concept to deployment.

- **Consistency**: Ensuring a consistent look and feel across your application can be challenging. RhinoUI's design tokens and components help maintain uniformity, enhancing the user interface without extra effort.

###  RhinoUI Packages
RhinoUI has two packages:

- [Components](https://github.com/rhinolabs/rhino-ui/tree/main/packages/components)
- [Design Tokens](https://github.com/rhinolabs/rhino-ui/tree/main/packages/design-tokens)

#### Components
The Components package `@rhino-ui/components` is a React component library. It offers a wide range of reusable UI components to accelerate frontend development while maintaining consistency and quality across applications.


#### Design Tokens
The Design Tokens package `@rhino-ui/design-tokens` provides a central location to store shared attributes of the RhinoUI Design System. These attributes include colors, fonts, spacing, and more. Using [Amazon's Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/), it transforms attributes into usable variables for a variety of platforms.
